# Part 2

## Overview

In this part, you'll dive into important concepts in Observability.
More specifically, you'll learn in-depth about Logs, Metrics and Traces.
You'll explore the need for each of them, their use case and the relation between them.
You'll also learn about how they complete each other and gives us the bigger picture.
TODO: TBD - add content.
