# Observability Showcase

After mastering all for elements of observability (Traces, Metrics, Logs, Events).
We can call you the Avatar of the Monitoring & Observability world!

As the avatar, we need you to save our data pipelines.

We have complex architecture of data pipeline that integrate with each other.
We heard about a concept called Data Observability, but as we don't master the world of observability, we don't have the right knowledge to research about this concept.

We need you to teach us what is Data Observability.

Create a presentation explaining what is Data Observability, features of it, how companies use it in real world (explain it with real-world/made-up architecture).
