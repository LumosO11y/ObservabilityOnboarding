# Part 4: Observability platforms and APM

## Overview

In this part, you'll learn about insights Observability gives us.
Observability platforms give us a lot of insight and capabilities about our system from the telemetry data.

## Goals

- Learn about different Observability platforms.
- Understand how we can choose the right solution based on our system.
- Learn some more Observability concepts.

## Outcome

The outcome of this part is a detailed markdown explaining the concepts you have learned in this part. Your markdown should also contain comparison between different Observability platforms.

In your markdown make sure there is an answer the following questions:

1. Explain the difference between SLI, SLO, SLA, their relation and how observability helps with either of them
	- explain in depth the importance of each
2. What are KPIs? How do they relate to SLI, SLO and SLA?
3. What are golden signals? Explain each one of them.
4. Explain the differences between Synthetic monitoring & RUM, where they differ and not.
5. Explain what is Session Replay. How it does it help up achieve monitoring?
5. Choose 4 features that RUM has and explain their usage and how they take place in the real-world.
6. What is MTTD and MTTR?
7. What are alerts, why are they important? What is an alert manager?
8. List 2 more insights Observability gives your system and explain them.
9. Provide a list of at least 3 on-prem observability solutions and 3 cloud observability solutions that exist today with comparison. (Read about the grafana stack)
