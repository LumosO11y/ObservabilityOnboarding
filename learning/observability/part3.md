# Part 3: Instrumentation

## Overview

In this part you will learn the yet another concept of Observability called Instrumentation, you will learn how to make your system observable and what are the different ways you can implement this concept.

## Goals

- Understand the concept of Instrumentation.
- Learn about different implementations of Instrumentation.
- Learn about different Instrumentation technologies

## Outcome
The outcome of this part should be a detailed markdown containing everything you learned about this concept.

In your markdown make sure there is an answer the following questions:

1. What is Instrumentation? Explain the concept and why is it important in making your application "observable".
2. What are the different ways of "instrumenting" your application. Can you use these methods at all times? Explain.
Explain how each of them work specifically in OpenTelemetry and in general.
3. What doesn't Zero-Code instrumentation allow that Code-Based does?
4. Detail about the use-cases when I would like to do Zero-Code instrumentation and Code-based instrumentation.
5. What are some instrumentation solutions that exist out there? Compare between at least 5 solutions.
6. Write a simple flask application in node-js and instrument it in both ways (Zero-code and Code-based). Output all signals to terminal.
