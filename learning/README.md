# Intro

Welcome to Lumos! We're thrilled to have you as a part of the team.
You will start your journey by learning about Observability as a concept, and you'll slowly dive into
advanced features and concepts in the Observability and Monitoring ecosystem.

## Note

Each chapter has multiple parts and has limited time to it.
You can handle the time for each part as you wish but make sure you don't step over the limited time defined for the chapter.
If you feel you need more time, contact your mentor.
