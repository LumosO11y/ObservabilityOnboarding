# Part 4

## Overview

In this part you'll learn about another concept of OpenTelemetry called instrumentation.
At the end of this part you will understand in-depth what instrumentation means and what are the different kinds of it.
You should also be familiar with instrumentation best practices and you should know how to instrument code.

### Action Items

In the end of this part you should answer the following questions:

1. Whats the difference between each of the instrumentation solutions?
   1. Why do we need each of them?
   2. When we should use them?
2. Name 2 different of instrumentation SDKs and explain the differences between them.
3. When instrumenting code based applications we usually have the luxury of using a pre-built integration to our base framework (fastapi, flask, etc). There are some cases where we don't have this luxury. What are the 2 ways of instrumentation in this example? explain in detail.
    1. Why won't we always have access to this "integrated instrumentation"?
    2. Give an example of a team from our branch that uses "custom instrumentation". Why did they choose this method?

4. Add instrumentation to an existing code. Talk with your tutor for more info.

## Outcome

You should finish this part after you added instrumentation to an existing component given you by your tutor.
