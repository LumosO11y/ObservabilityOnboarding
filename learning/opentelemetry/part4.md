# Part 4

## Overview

In this part you'll learn about another concept of OpenTelemetry called instrumentation.
At the end of this part you should make sure you know in-depth what instrumentation means and
what kinds of instrumentation there are.
You should also be familiar of instrumentation best practices and you should known how to instrument code.

### Action Items

In the end of this part you should answer the following questions:

1. Whats the difference between each of the instrumentation techniques?
   1. Why do we need each of them?
   2. When we should use them?
2. Name 2 different of instrumentation SDKs and tell the differences between them.
3. Add instrumentation to an existing code. Talk with your tutor for more info.

## Outcome

You should finish this part after you added instrumentation to an existing component given you by your tutor.
