# Part 2

## Overview

In this part you'll learn about the OpenTelemetry specifications.
At the end of this part, you'll know in detail about the OpenTelemetry specification.
Especially, you'll know the OTLP protocol and other semantic conventions set by OpenTelemetry.

## Goals 
  - Learn about OTLP protocol and why it is needed
  - Understand the inner workings of the OTLP 
  - Learn about and understand the important protocols that you will use daily.

## Outcome
The outcome of this part should be a detailed markdown containing everything you have learned about OTLP and an **article explaining about the OpenTelemetry specifications in depth**.

1. Explain what is gRPC and the need for it.
2. How can you connect an external environment to a pod in a k8s cluster using gRPC. What would be the entire flow ?
3. What are the disadvantages of gRPC in internal cluster communication ?
4. Explain what is Protobuf and what problem does it solve.
5. What is OTLP?
6. Why is OTLP needed?
7. What are the disadvantages of gRPC in internal cluster communication ?
8. Give 2 alternatives to OTLP and explain them in detail. Provide pro's and con's of each of them.
9. What is the OTLP specification - explain.
10. Write a short paragraph explaining about OpenTelemetry specification.
11. What are the semantic conventions specifications in OpenTelemetry and why are they needed?
12. List some of the semantic conventions.
13. What is Open Agent Management Protocol? What is its use case?
